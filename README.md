# LUNA'S LEOPARD GECKOS

Luna's Leopard Geckos are an enthusiastic hobbyist breeder. They have been successfully breeding geckos for many years with their most recent aim to reach a wider audience of like minded reptile keepers and provide them with high quality and healthy pets.

On this site users will find a brief description of who the client is, reassuring users that they will be purchasing from a reputable breeder. Users can also find a catalogue of available geckos along with a FAQ page that will be especially helpful to new keepers.

Users can get in contact with the client via the contact page or by redirecting to their social pages.

In this section, you will include a few paragraphs providing an overview of your project.
Essentially, this part is your "sales pitch".

At this stage, you should have a name for your project so use it!
Don't introduce the project as a "portfolio project" for the diploma.

In this section, describe what the project hopes to accomplish, who it is intended to target, and how it will be useful to the target audience.

Consider adding a mockup image using the "Am I Responsive" website.
Here's your deployed site as an example:
https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://dougyb83.github.io/Lunas-Leopard-Geckos

Screenshots for the README and testing should not be inside of `assets/` or `static/` image folders.
(reminder: `assets/` and `static/` are for files used on the live site, not documentation)
Consider adding a new folder called `documentation`, and add the amiresponsive screenshot inside of that folder.
To add the image into your README, use this format:
(assuming you have a new folder called `documentation` with an image called "mockup.png")

![screenshot](documentation/mockup.png)

Note: Markdown files (.md) should not contain HTML elements like `img`, `br`, `div`, `a`, etc, only Markdown formatting.
Find out more about using Markdown elements here:

## UX

Upon landing on the home page I wanted it to be clear to the user that the site is focused on Leopard geckos and selling them. As Leopard geckos are naturally very colourful, bright and vibrant it makes sense to have a picture of one as the main focus point. This will be the hero image. It will be the full width of the screen but will not be the full height so that users can see that there is more to see below if they were to scroll down.

### Colour Scheme

Leopard geckos can have many bright colours, but the most common are yellow or orange with black and white stripes and dots. this will influence the colour scheme using black/grey for the background and nav bar, yellow for logo's and orange for buttons and sub headings. But keeping main titles and text white as I feel adding colours to these made them more difficult to read.

- `#f1fef5` used for primary text.
- `#ff5d00` used for primary highlights.
- `#e0ece4` used for secondary text.
- `#dcc429` used for secondary highlights.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/ff5d00-dcc429-e0ece4-f1fef5) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

I used [fontjoy.com](https://fontjoy.com/) to generate font pairings as follows:

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for the primary headers.
- [Averia Gruesa Libre](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Averia+Gruesa+Libre) was used for sub headings.
- [Sarala](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Sarala) was used for all other secondary text.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## Wireframes

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.
